pootle upgrade starting Thu (16-12-15), 10:00 UTC
=================================================

Starting Thursday morning at 10:00 UTC, our instance of `pootle`_ will be
upgraded. The server will not be available for translators during that time.

While we plan for the upgrade to be done within a few hours, don't be alarmed if pootle is not available.
