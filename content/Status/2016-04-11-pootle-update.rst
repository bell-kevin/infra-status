Planned downtime of Pootle
##########################

A pootle security update needs to be installed.
Due to the needed database migrations, this might take quite a long time. The update process starts on Monday, 18 April, 0300 UTC and might take up to 12 hours. During that timeframe, pootle will be offline.
