Outage of Falco
################

Due to a massive disk failure on our hypervisor falco, the following services are offline at the moment:

- Gerrit
- CI
- Bugzilla

Other services might be affected as well.

We will keep you up-to-date.


Update July 26, 0735UTC
=======================

Gerrit, Jenkins, Bugzilla are back up.
